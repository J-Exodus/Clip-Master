# Clip-Master
Python based program with a GUI interface to expediate extracting video clips from multiple video files. 
The program was designed to extract gameplay clips from multiple saved gameplay recordings and automatically store them
for later use in montages, etc to be uploaded to YouTube.

### Project Current State

This is my first project that I am doing through GitHub. Happy for any help/guidance in general Github setup and in the
coding of the program itself. This project is not yet complete/functional. I still need to finish the GUI integration
and then write the functions for the clip extraction.

The completed project will allow the user to do the following:
- Open videos in VLC player in succession and mark in and out positions for clips they want extracted.
- Input a title for each particular clip as they are marked.
- Use ffmpeg to extract each clip in a batch process.
- Save extracted clips to a particular directory.
- Move videos that have been processed into a different directory.
