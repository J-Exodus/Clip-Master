# Clip-Master
Python based program with a GUI interface to expediate extracting video clips from multiple video files. 
The program was designed to extract gameplay clips from multiple saved gameplay recordings and automatically store them for later
use in montages, etc to be uploaded to YouTube.

This is my first project that I am doing through GitHub. Happy for any help/guidance in general Github setup and in the coding of the program itself.
This project is not yet complete/functional. I still need to finish the GUI integration and then write the functions for the clip extraction.
